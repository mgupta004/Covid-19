# 🇮🇳 COVID-19 Deaths Analysis | Personal Tribute & Data Science Project

## 💔 Background
In 2021, my grandfather fought a severe battle against COVID-19 but tragically lost his life. Like many families across the world, mine experienced the helplessness and grief that accompanied the pandemic. This project is my personal tribute to him — and to all the lives lost — through a meaningful analysis of COVID-19 death patterns in India.

## 🎯 Objective
To explore, visualize, and understand the distribution and trends of COVID-19-related deaths across Indian states using publicly available data. The aim is to draw insights from the data, reflect on the national impact, and potentially identify trends that could inform future policy or awareness campaigns.

## 📊 Dataset
The data is sourced from publicly available COVID-19 datasets (e.g., Ministry of Health, Kaggle, or covid19india.org). It includes:
- Daily case counts
- Death statistics
- State-wise breakdowns
- Time-series analysis

## 📂 Contents
- `Covid_19.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data cleaning, EDA, visualizations, and insights.
- `images/`: Folder for generated graphs and charts (if any).
- `datset:containg the dataset.
- `README.md`: This file.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Plotly (for interactive graphs)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📈 Highlights of the Analysis
- Trend analysis of deaths during the first and second wave.
- State-wise comparison of fatality rates.
- Death spikes aligned with healthcare strain (ICU occupancy, oxygen shortages).
- Correlation of testing and death rates.

## 🙏 Dedication
This project is dedicated to my grandfather and to the countless families affected by COVID-19. May we continue to learn from the data, remember the lives lost, and work toward a healthier, more prepared future.

## 🔗 Future Work
- Integrate vaccination and recovery data
- Forecasting future wave severity using ARIMA/ML models
- Policy recommendation dashboard using Streamlit
